# Library within dataSpace explore, create, update all data matters 

## Overview
The library plays a critical role in HOP and thus BentoBoxDS.  The fundamental building blocks of data are described.  Two primary contracts:  Reference Contracts and Module Contracts.  There is a special type of module contract called a Network Experiment (NXP) contract that bundles together a minimum of four module contracts:  Question, Data packaging, Compute and Visualization.  BentoBoxDS has a explorer viewer and tools to create and add any data source to the HOP network.
