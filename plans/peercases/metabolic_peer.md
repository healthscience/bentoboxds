# Peer Case: The Metabolic Peer
**Focus:** Biological Homeostasis & Circadian Alignment

## The Challenge
The Peer experiences recurring energy dips and high cortisol (Boundary Overshoot) during the 15:00 - 17:00 Sector (Solar Arcs 225° to 255°).

## The Emulation Goal
To identify the "Sweet Spot" for glucose and heart rate variability (HRV) that allows the Peer to maintain Phase Coherence during the late afternoon.

## Goldilocks Parameters
- **Inner Ring (Peer):** HRV should stay within the "Harmony Band" of 40ms - 70ms.
- **Resonance Trigger:** If HRV drops while Solar Intensity (External) is at peak, trigger a "Recovery Arc" prompt.

## The Consilience Moment
The Besearch cycle proves that a 10-minute "Grounding" action at Arc 230° pulls the Cortisol wedge back from the Hot Zone into the Harmony Band.
