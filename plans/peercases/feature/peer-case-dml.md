## Use case 3: decentralized machine learning


### Introduction
The Coherence Ledger create by a complete HOP cycle opens up the possibility of decentralized machine learning. As genetic or evolutionary algorithms are well suited to being distributed then the 'fine tuning' of an autoregression model variable will be experimented with first. Next aggregating a TINY LLM model will be attempted.  Two peers initially and then more will be added to the network.  


### Step 1: Proof of work challenge
This is to give two peer the evidence they have the same data sets and enough quality to be a meaning form machine learning opportunity.


### Step 2: Genetic algorithm  (GE)
Agreement on the genetic algorithm being used and #check the signature to ensure both.

### Step 3: Autoregression model
Agreement on the autoregression model being used and #check the signature to ensure both.

### Step 4: Training
As the GE stars, then HOP cycles will be completed and we need to produce a coherence ledger entry, proof of work of the training process.

### Step 5: Testing - making a prediction or simulation
The testing of the model will be done by the two peers and the results will be compared. The best model will be selected and the other peer will be asked to test the model again. This will be repeated until the model is agreed upon.

### Step 6: Deployment
The deployment of the model will be done by the two peers and the results will be compared. The best model will be selected and the other peer will be asked to deploy the model again. This will be repeated until the model is agreed upon.

### Step 7: Improving
Can population between peer to 'bread' or top performing models combined under some rules?

### Step 8  Computation resource
We need to keep tabs on the amount of computation resource used locally by a peer.  There will need to be a balance between the amount of computation resource used and the amount of computation resource available. And what the peer priorities are for DML activity v updating data and bentoboxes of interest.


Specific example:  predicting the average heart rate given steps walked.
