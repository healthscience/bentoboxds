# Peer Case: The Economic Peer
**Focus:** Value Flow & Resource Vitality

## The Challenge
The Peer’s "Proof of Value" (Work/Output) is currently decoupled from their "Proof of Health," leading to burnout (Energy Deficiency).

## The Emulation Goal
To treat capital and energy as a single "Metabolic Flow." We map BTC/Currency volatility against the Peer’s internal stress markers.

## Goldilocks Parameters
- **Outer Ring (Global):** Resource allocation vs. Personal Energy Expenditure.
- **Resonance Trigger:** If market volatility (External) aligns with a "Peer Stress Wedge," suggest a "Decoupling Protocol."

## The Consilience Moment
The Peer discovers that their highest economic "Resonance" happens when they work in sync with their natural Circadian Arcs, rather than fighting against the Clock.
