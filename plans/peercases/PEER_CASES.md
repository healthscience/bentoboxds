Read these four peer cases. They are the 'North Star' for our Besearch UI. Every time we run a search, we are trying to bring the user closer to the 'Consilience Moment' described in these files.




# HOP Peer Case Library

## 1. Metabolic Peer: Circadian Homeostasis
**Core Metric:** HRV & Glucose vs. Solar Intensity.
**The "Wicked Problem":** Cortisol Overshoot at Solar Arc 230° (15:20).
**Resonance Target:** Aligning nutrient intake and "Recovery Arcs" to maintain the 40ms - 70ms Harmony Band.

## 2. Ecological Peer: Bioregional Symbiosis
**Core Metric:** Peer Water Usage vs. River Flow/Nitrate Levels.
**The "Wicked Problem":** Nitrate Overshoot at Earth Degree 120°.
**Resonance Target:** Matching personal household output to the "Ebb and Flow" of the local watershed.

---

## 3. Economic Peer: Value Flow Resonance
**Core Metric:** BTC/Capital Volatility vs. Peer Energy Expenditure.
**The "Wicked Problem":** Burnout (Energy Deficiency) caused by decoupling work-arcs from biological-arcs.
**Resonance Target:** Synchronizing economic "Proof of Value" with natural Circadian peaks to minimize biological "Tax."

## 4. Consilience Peer: The Unified Life-Strap
**Core Metric:** The Overlap of all Nested Rings.
**The "Wicked Problem":** Systematic fragmentation (Health, Wealth, and Earth feeling like separate systems).
**Resonance Target:** Total Coherence. Achieving the "Green Sweet Spot" across all three rings of the Holistic Wheel at the same Arc.
