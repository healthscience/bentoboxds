# Peer Case: The Ecological Peer
**Focus:** Bioregional Symbiosis & River Resonance

## The Challenge
The local river basin is experiencing "Nitrate Overshoot" due to seasonal runoff at Earth Degree 120° (The Great Orbit).

## The Emulation Goal
To map the Peer’s personal water usage to the River’s "Pulse." We are emulating the river as a living extension of the Peer's own circulatory system.

## Goldilocks Parameters
- **Middle Ring (Network):** River flow velocity should stay within the 0.5 - 1.2 m/s Harmony Band.
- **Resonance Trigger:** When Nitrogen levels hit the "Hot Zone," the Peer's local node suggests an "Absorption Planting" cycle.

## The Consilience Moment
The Peer reduces household output during peak runoff Arcs, showing a direct correlation between Peer behavior and the River's return to the Sweet Spot.
